***PROGRAM How to change guitar strings for dummies***

*Start*

**This guide will cover how to remove/replace/tune a new set of standard .09-.42 guitar strings onto a 6 string guitar**

*Initialize*

**Get: Materials**

>Strings [.42, .32, .24, .16, .11, .09]
>
>Wirecutters

**Case: Guitar/Bridge/Headstock Type**

> i. Is it an electric or acoustic?
> 
>> a) if acoustic assume peg bridge and 3x3 headstock and jump to "Remove old strings"
>> 
>> b) else if electric continue with next step
>> 
> ii. Is the headstock inline 6 or 3x3?
> 
> iii. Is the bridge a through body, top load, or peg?

**Function: Remove Old Strings**

> i. Using a pair of wire cutters: cut string. (loop until all strings are cut)
> 
> ii. Remove string fragments from bridge (loop until all string fragments removed from bridge)
> 
>> a) If thru body style, remove from back of guitar
>> 
>> b) else if top load, remove from the bottom of the bridge
>> 
>> c) else if peg, remove peg, then remove string
>> 
> iii. Remove string fragments from headstock (loop until all string fragments removed from headstock)
> 
>> a) Unwind string from tuning peg and remove (process is the same for both inline 6 and 3x3)

**Function: Install New Strings**

> i. Thread in new strings  to bridge (loop until all strings are threaded into bridge)
> 
>> a) From bottom (near the volume/tone knobs) 
>> 
>> b) To the top (near the strap button) 
>> 
>> c) With the .09 gauge being at the bottom and the .42 gauge being at the top
>> 
>>> 1) if thru body style, thread from the back
>>> 
>>> 2) else if top load, thread from the bottom of the bridge
>>> 
>>> 3) else if peg, insert string and replace peg on top to secure
>>> 
> ii. Thread into tuning pegs (loop until all strings are threaded into tuning pegs)
> 
>> a) if inline 6 thread .42 in the nearest and repeat with decending gauges in order down the line to the last one with .09 gauge
>> 
>> b) else if 3x3 thread .42 in the nearest tuning peg on the left, repeat process clockwise for all tuning pegs
>> 
> iii. Turn tuning pegs counter-clockwise on left side of headstock (else if 3x3: clockwise on right side) to tension the strings

**Function: Release Tension From New Strings**

> i. Pull gently on each string to release tension (will detune)
> 
> ii. Retenion each string and loop process until strings no longer detunes

**Function: Tune Guitar**

> i. Tune up (clockwise) tune down (counter-clockwise) else if 3x3 reverse rotation for d), e), f)
> 
>> a) (.42 gauge) string (E)
>> 
>> b) (.32 gauge) (A)
>> 
>> c) (.24 gauge) (D)
>> 
>> d) (.16 gauge) (G)
>> 
>> e) (.11 gauge) (B)
>> 
>> f) (.09 gauge) (E)
>> 
> ii. Trim any excess pieces from headstock with wire cutters
> 
> iii. Rock on padre/madre
