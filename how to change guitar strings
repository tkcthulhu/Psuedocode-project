***How to change guitar strings for dummies***

**This guide will cover how to remove/replace/tune a new set of standard .09-.42 guitar strings onto a 6 string guitar**

**Determine guitar type**
>i. Is it an electric or acoustic?
>>a) if acoustic assume peg bridge and 3x3 headstock and jump to "Remove old strings"
>>b) if electric continue with current steps
>ii. Is the headstock inline 6 or 3x3?
>iii. Is the bridge a through body, top load, or peg?

**Remove old strings**
>i. Using a pair of wire cutters, cut each string.
>ii. Remove string fragments from bridge
>>a) If thru body style, remove from back of guitar
>>b) If top load, remove from the bottom of the bridge
>>c) If peg, remove peg, then remove string, repeat for each string
>iii. Remove string fragments from headstock
>>a) Unwind string from tuning peg and remove, process is the same for both inline 6 and 3x3

**Install new strings**
>i. Thread in new strings to bridge
>>a) From bottom (near the volume/tone knobs) 
>>b) To the top (near the strap button) 
>>c) With the .09 gauge being at the bottom and the .42 gauge being at the top
>>>1) If thru body style, thread from the back
>>>2) If top load, thread from the bottom of the bridge
>>>3) If peg, insert string and replace peg on top to secure
>ii. Thread in to tuning pegs
>>a) For inline 6 thread .42 in the nearest and repeat with decending gauges in order down the line to the last one with .09 gauge
>>b) For 3x3 thread .42 in the nearest tuning peg on the left, repeat process clockwise for all tuning pegs
>iii. Turn tuning pegs counter-clockwise on left side of headstock (clockwise on right side for 3x3) to tension the strings

**Release tension from new strings**
>i. Pull gently on each string to release tension (will detune)
>ii. Retenion each string and repeat process until strings no longer detunes

**Tune guitar**
>i. Tune from top to bottom
>>a) Top (Thickest) string (E)
>>b) 2nd from top (A)
>>c) 3rd from top (D)
>>d) 4th from top (G)
>>e) 5th from top (B)
>>f) 6th from top (E)
>ii. Trim any excess pieces from headstock with wire cutters
>iii. Rock on padre/madre
